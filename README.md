# Synchronous-FIFO
# Design and Implementation of a Synchronous FIFO in IcarusVerilog <br>

//> A First in First out (FIFO) is a Hardware Module, used in Digital Circuits which serves as a synchronizer between the modules. <br>

//> When Data is transferring between the modules which has different clock frequencies( this phenomenon is called Clock Domain Crossing(CDC)), FIFO acts as a bridge between them in order to synchronize the data transfer correctly. <br>

//> FIFO Usage matters when Data transfer is happening between the modules where Write clock frequency >> Read clock frequency. <br>
